## Why write?

I've spent years building things — from accountancy practice automation to indie SaaS products to multi-agent AI systems. Along the way, I've accumulated notebooks full of hard-won lessons that never made it past my local machine.

This site is the fix. A place to think out loud, share what I've learned, and connect the dots between the things I'm building.

## What to expect

I plan to write about:

- **Engineering** — the tools, patterns, and architectures I reach for
- **Building products** — the decisions that matter when shipping solo
- **AI agents** — practical experience running autonomous systems in production

Not every post will be polished. Some will be rough notes from the workshop floor. That's the point.

## How this site works

The stack is intentionally simple:

```typescript
const stack = {
  framework: "Next.js 16",
  content: "MDX + Velite",
  styling: "Tailwind CSS 4",
  hosting: "Vercel",
  comments: "Giscus",
};
```

Content lives as MDX files in the repository. No database, no CMS. `git push` deploys.

> The best publishing system is the one that gets out of your way. For me, that means files in a repo.

### Directory structure

Posts are organised as directories with co-located assets:

```
content/
  posts/
    hello-world/
      index.mdx      ← this file
      diagram.png     ← co-located images
  projects/
    gas-town.yaml     ← project data
  bookshelf/
    .gitkeep
```

Each post directory can hold images, diagrams, and supplementary files alongside the MDX content. No separate asset pipeline needed.

### The authoring flow

1. Write MDX with frontmatter
2. Drop images in the post directory
3. Commit and push
4. Vercel builds and deploys

That's it. No build step to remember, no deploy button to click.

## What's next

I have a backlog of topics I want to cover. First up will likely be something on [multi-agent orchestration](/posts/hello-world) — the system that built parts of this very site.

If any of this sounds interesting, stick around. There's more coming.
